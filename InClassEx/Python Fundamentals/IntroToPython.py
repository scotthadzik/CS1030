# This is a Comment
#   Python is an interpreted language
#       --> It is compiled everytime that it runs
    #   Advatages
    #       --> Easier to Debug
    #               Fails imediately when run
    #               Comiled laguages may compile but not run
    #       --> Very portable 
    #               all you need is the interpreter to run python
    #   Disadvantage
    #       --> Slower. Inefficient to compile code everytime you run it
# Can be run in a real time interpreter or written in a file and run in the terminal

# Spacing matters
